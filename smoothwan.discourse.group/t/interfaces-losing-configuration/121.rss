    <title>Interfaces losing configuration</title>
    <link>https://smoothwan.discourse.group/t/interfaces-losing-configuration/121</link>
    <description>It has taken hours to get my configuration setup so that I have connection to my Netgear M6 through WAN (eth0), and my Verizon cell service (on iPhone) through wlan1.  Had it working and then if if I reboot anything I have to go back through the interfaces and set everything back up again.  Such a pain and makes this not a very viable solution to take to sporting events where between games I turn everything off to save battery power, then turn back on for the next event.  Any suggestions?</description>

            <p>This sounds like a failed firmware update, you can try reflashing the image to make sure.<br>
(<code>/etc/uci-defaults</code> should be empty)</p>
