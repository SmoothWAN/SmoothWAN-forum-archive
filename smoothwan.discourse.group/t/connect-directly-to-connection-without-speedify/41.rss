    <title>Connect directly to connection without speedify</title>
    <link>https://smoothwan.discourse.group/t/connect-directly-to-connection-without-speedify/41</link>
    <description>Is there any way to use one of the connections for internet access without going though Speedify?   I have SmoothWAN set up on a Slate with three three connections (two wired, one wireless) that are bonded via Speedify.  The issue I am trying to address is that many services such as Netflix block VPN connections.  While Speedify does have what they call &#39;bypass&#39; mode, this does not always work.  However, on a pc, if I first connect directly though a local internet connection to Netflix and once streaming has started, I switch to speedify, the connection is not blocked.  I would like to be able to do the same with SmoothWAN</description>

            <p>Yes, unfortunately, the current method of bypass doesn’t handle interfaces going down and up, only loss of internet connectivity.</p>

            <p>talking to myself here: this doesn’t always work. for some reason, it gets blocked again, then unblocked, then blocked. it’s almost random.</p>

            <p>Thanks for this. I was able to make this work. My (wired) LG TV can now bypass Speedify and stream Disney. Just wondering: is this still taking advantage of the bonded internet? The incoming interface is ‘lan’ only.</p>
<p>Also I did not know what to put after my device IP eg 172.17.17.100/?? so I put 24 and it seems to work. For my other TV, can I use the same IP 172.17.17.100 and put /32? so I do not need to create a separate bypass route for each device? Thanks</p>

            <p>Yes via PBR or VPN policy based routing, I’ll write a short guide for the next release, the current release is traffic leaky.</p>
