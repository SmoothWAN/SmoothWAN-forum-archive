    <title>Mystery route 123.123.123.123</title>
    <link>https://smoothwan.discourse.group/t/mystery-route-123-123-123-123/99</link>
    <description>I’m running on a PC-based platform, with non-USB Ethernet ports, and a Quectel EC25 LTE modem. I am using this image: SmoothWAN-0.99.9HF5-PC-EFI-AMD64-DiskImage-or-WebUI.img

I have the following extras activated:
  -- Speedify
  -- Tailscale

The following route is in my routing table, and I don&#39;t know why, or how it was installed:

123.123.123.123 via 100.68.15*.** dev wwan0

&quot;wwan0&quot; is the Quectel-based 4G-LTE Cellular connection.

123.123.123.123 is a Chinese-based IP which makes this seem even more suspicious.

This is a new install and configuration, I started working on this last week and just got things working a day or so ago.  I don&#39;t recall this route being there prior to the SPeedify or Tailscale install, so I suspect one of those.
I&#39;m using ModemManager to configure the Quectel interface, so tht could potentially be the culprit.

Here are the logs and config from the machine:

Any idea what is installing this route, and more importantly, why?</description>

            <p>Thanks!.  It looks like it is in the TinyFEC config, I think it must be a bug.  I never enabled it, and I can’t seem to get rid of it.  It’s no big deal, I’ll just ignore it.</p>

            <p>The route is added by either TinyFEC or Engarde when enabled, 123.123.123.123 is a formatting example in the web UI dialog.</p>
<p>Simply remove the IP in TinyFEC or Engarde as it seems like you have accidentally enabled one of them, else this is a bug. The route is meaningless in this state, it’s for making Engarde/TinyFEC use the latest connected WAN in case the user doesn’t set metric routes when they add multiple WAN interfaces. OpenWrt does not add default routes in this case.</p>
<p>TODO: Moving to UI input text placeholders next release and converting to LUCI-JS api since there are few issues with the LUA based LuCI apps on new OpenWrt.</p>
