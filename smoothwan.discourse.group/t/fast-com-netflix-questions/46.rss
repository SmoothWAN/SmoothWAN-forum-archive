    <description>In the log of Speedify trigger/install there are two errors at the end of the log:
interface wan not found
interface wan6 not found
![image|690x364](upload://6BsfnzzRmv30x9NqhkDWnLXHnU0.png)

Also I connect to three bonded (two wired, on on 2.4 GHz) and do a regular speed test everything is fine.  If I do a speed test with fast.com, it does not seem to use the bonded channels, there is no throughput seen on the status screen and the speed from fast.com is that of one of the wired connections (a dsl line).  Fast.com also indicates that it is connecting to a server that I would expect from the dsl line and not one from speedify.  This behavior is different from HF4 where the throughput did show up on the status screen, the speed reflected bonded lines and the server is one that I would expect with speedify.

I have reflashed between HF4 and HF5 a number of times and the behavior is always the same.

Also the system log shows lots of errors, I dont know how to attach it to this post</description>

            <p>When I tried it a while back, it did not make a difference.  However, I think that maybe Netflix only checks for VPN or geoblocking at the beginning of a stream.  If this is the case, connecting with a residential IP that is not blocked and then switching to Speedify would work, at least this has seemed to work.</p>

            <p>It does seem that which servers are blocked by Netflix changes rather rapidly.  The DNS issue may have been beneficial in some cases.  I was hoping that Speedify would allow VPN chaining to a private server with a residential IP that would not be blocked, but they do not.  The only other way to bypass this blocking to to first connect directly via a non VPN connection without Speedify and then once a stream is active, to switch to Speedify (had had a previous question about this to you).  This can easily be done with a PC where it is easy to switch wifi connections (one direct and the second though Speedify)</p>

            <p>Yes, HF4 had DNS issues, note that some Speedify servers are not blocked by Netflix but still geo-restricted, probably more than direct connection.</p>

            <p>using <a href="http://fast.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">fast.com</a> there is activity in the bypass graph, so it is bypassing</p>
<p>using <a href="http://speedtest.net" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">speedtest.net</a> the connection is bonded and not bypassing</p>
<p>It is strange that it behaves difference in behavior between HF4 and HF5</p>

            <p>That means Netflix bypass wasn’t working in HF4.<br>
(note: <a href="http://fast.com">fast.com</a> is provided by netflix)<br>
Is it happening with <a href="http://speedtest.net">speedtest.net</a>?</p>

            <p>I thought it should be, but in HF4 is seems not to be.  I have switched between HF4 and HF5 three times and the behavior is always the same - bonded in HF4 and not in HF5.</p>

            <p>Isn’t <a href="http://fast.com">fast.com</a> Netflix and bypassed automatically by Speedify?<br>
Is there activity in the bypassed graph inside Speedify?</p>
