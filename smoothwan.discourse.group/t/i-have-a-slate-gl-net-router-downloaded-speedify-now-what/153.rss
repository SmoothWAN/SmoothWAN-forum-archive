    <title>I have a Slate GL-Net Router, Downloaded Speedify - now What?</title>
    <link>https://smoothwan.discourse.group/t/i-have-a-slate-gl-net-router-downloaded-speedify-now-what/153</link>
    <description>Newbie, Got file, downloaded the file onto my Slate Ax Router, now I can not connect to my Router.  Connects actually but says no Internet.  I look for the WiFi SmoothWAN Setup but also not there.  I thought was next step.  Not sure what to do? 

Steps I took:
Router on, PC signed into GL 5G wifi from router.  On PC went to router webpage address and under upgrades downloaded and brought over file to install.  I did hit Keep settings - (Maybe my issue)  It installed, once done no access to that webpage address any longer, and no wifi to select called SmoothWan.  My Router wifi shows up still, I connect but no interent? 

Any help would be great.

Thanks,

Brandon</description>

            <p>Hold the reset button for 10 seconds then release, it should reset shortly after, should be ready in 2 minutes.</p>
<p>If that didnâ€™t work here is the restore procedure: <a href="https://docs.gl-inet.com/router/en/4/faq/debrick/" class="inline-onebox">Debrick via Uboot - GL.iNet Router Docs 4</a><br>
Keep settings is a problem when mixing different firmware.</p>
