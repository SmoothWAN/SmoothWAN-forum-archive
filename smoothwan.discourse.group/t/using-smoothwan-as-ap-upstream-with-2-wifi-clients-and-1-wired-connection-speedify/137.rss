    <title>Using smoothwan as AP , upstream with 2 wifi clients and 1 wired connection (speedify)</title>
    <link>https://smoothwan.discourse.group/t/using-smoothwan-as-ap-upstream-with-2-wifi-clients-and-1-wired-connection-speedify/137</link>
    <description>I&#39;d like to use Smoothwan on a RPI , where the RPI acts as the Access Points for my clients . The upstream consists of one wired connection, and 2 wifi connections , which will be bonded with Speedify. 

The RPI has one wifi chip on board, so I would need to add two Wifi USB chips. 

Is this possible with Smoothwan?  And is it possible with a RPI ?  I understand there might be some performance hits on frequency level due to running 3 wifi connections simultaneously, but am I wondering the the RPI and software can manage that all wifi connections at once.</description>

            <p>The Slate AX/Flint is definitly the choice for AP. Pi’s Wi-Fi is unstable.<br>
It can also connect to client and act as an AP at the same time per radio, there are 2 with different frequncies 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz.</p>

            <p>Just to add, if this can bedone with e.g. the Gl-Inet Slate device by plugging in an extra Wifi point via the USB port, that would be work for me as well.</p>
