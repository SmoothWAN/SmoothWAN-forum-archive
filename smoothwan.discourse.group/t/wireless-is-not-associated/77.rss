    <title>&quot;Wireless is not associated&quot;</title>
    <link>https://smoothwan.discourse.group/t/wireless-is-not-associated/77</link>
    <description>I have followed all instructions and have added my Netgear M6 Hotspot as WLAN0 with connectivity and it is showing up in Speedify Overview page.  I have also added my home wifi network, but it is not showing in Speedify and has a message under the Wireless Overview section that says &quot;Wireless is not associated&quot;.  I can&#39;t figure out what that means or how to correct it so that I can use another internet connection in Speedify.</description>
