    <title>AdGuard breaks Tmobile connections</title>
    <link>https://smoothwan.discourse.group/t/adguard-breaks-tmobile-connections/129</link>
    <description>For the first time I tried adguard home feature today. 
The Adguard GUI indicated it was working fine with metrics and whatnot. 
Unfortunately, it immediately caused strange behavior in the Speedify GUI within smoothwan. Every other refresh cycle for the connection info it showed the 2 TMobile connections as dropped off of the active connection list or at the very least with 0 download, but my starlink and Pair and Share connections worked fine. (interestingly the phones connected through pair and share are google fi through TMobile) 
If i disable Adguard home and reboot the router, all is back to normal.</description>

            <p>Interesting, check in private/incognito tab as well, some browsers addons may be the problem.</p>

            <p>I checked and yes it happens with all servers. It seems to be an issue with the speedify plugin. It was doing it without adguard so I uninstalled the speedify, waited a day, and reinstalled. Now its working ok but Iâ€™ll give it some time and report back. I did try uninstall/reinstall once before and one other time reimaging smoothwan and it started again both times after an hour or so.</p>
